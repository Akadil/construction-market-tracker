This service will yield ("return") the full info about the tender

- The purpose of getTender() function is to get the latest tenders. so it will just make a request for the website and retrieve the latest tender. All configurations has to be set from outside, it should just its work

Ok, if it is like this, then what is the outside sources? 
- config file
- config handler has to be inside of that module. So I will be able to retrieve the file as I would like. I can do it for my future tasks, but it should be super isolated. I have to create it as an isolated one.
